# Vipps Order Management API v1

ðŸ’¥ DRAFT: This is unfinished work and subject to change. ðŸ’¥

This repository contains developer resources for the Vipps Order Management API.

The Order Management API allows merchants to send rich receipt information to existing Vipps transaction.
This information is shown to the customer in the app in their order history.
This functionality is available for both recurring and direct payments, but not for passthrough payments.
