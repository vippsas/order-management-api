# Introduction to Vipps Order Management
Vipps Order Management enables you to communicate with your customers through the payment reciepts in the Vipps app. The purpose of doing this is to give your customers more convenience, better overview and a more compelling shopping experience when they use Vipps to pay for your products and services. Vipps Order management also enables you to draw customers back to your site.

## Vipps Order Management capabilities
Vipps Order Management currently has the following capabilities:

* Links
* Images of order
* Proof of purchase / Valid reciept

### Links
In order to provide customers with more up to date information about their order, you can add a URL / link to the payment reciept in Vipps that can take the customer to a location on your site. Links are activated when a customer clicks the link area on the Vipps reciept. The mobile device's standard web browser will open and the user is redirected to the link location.

Below you can se an example of a Vipps reciept containing a link to "Shipping information".

Links have a type or category that will affect infographics and how it is handled in the Vipps app. We currently support these cathegories:

- **Reciept**: A link to a location where the customer can access and download a valid proof of purchase and reciept for this particular order
- **Order Confirmation**: A link to a location that contains information and status of the order. If your webshop or site has a "My orders" page or similar - this link cathegory can take the customer there.
- **Delivery information**: A link to a location that contains information and status about the shipping or delivery related to the order. This could be a link to hosted by your freight carrier, or a link to your site. If your webshop or site has a "My order" page that includes delivery related information about the order - this link cathegory can be used.
- **Ticket**: A link to a location where the customer can access and download a ticket to an event, travel or transportation.
- **Booking**: A link to a location that contains information and status about a booking, such as travel and rental booking. If your webshop or site has a "My bookings" page or similar, this link cathegory can take the customer there.
- **General**: If no of the other cathegories fit the use case for the link, a *General* cathegory can be used. This is a link to a location that contains any kind of information pertinent to the order. We encourage you to use the more specific cathegories if possible. 


### Images of order
With Vipps Order Management API you can upload an image that represents the order. This could be a specific image showing the product in this order, a collection of images that will be shown as a collage in Vipps. Below you can see an example of a Vipps reciept containing an image of the shopping card (single product)
