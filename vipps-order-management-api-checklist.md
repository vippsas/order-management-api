## Checklist for full integration

- [ ] Integrate the applicable [API endpoints][order-mgmt-api-reference-url]:
    - [ ] As this API allows you to update transactions that have been created by using the [eCom API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/ecom-api), [ePayment API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/epayment-api), or [Recurring API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api), you may need to implement the associated checklist(s) from these.
    - [ ] Add an image to an order [`POST:/order-management/v1/images`][add-image-endpoint]
    - [ ] Add category to an order [`PUT:/order-management/v2/{{paymentType}}/categories/{{orderId}}`][add-category-endpoint]
    - [ ] Add receipt to an order [`POST:/order-management/v2/{{paymentType}}/receipts/{{orderId}}`][add-receipt-endpoint]
    - [ ] Get order with category and receipt [`GET:/order-management/v2/{{paymentType}}/{{orderId}}`][get-order-endpoint]
       - For examples of requests and responses, see the
         [Order Management Postman collection](tools/vipps-order-management-api-postman-collection.json) and
         [environment](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/tools/vipps-api-global-postman-environment.json).
- [ ] Send the [Vipps HTTP headers](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/common-topics/http-headers)
      in all API requests for better tracking and troubleshooting:
    - [ ] `Merchant-Serial-Number`
    - [ ] `Vipps-System-Name`
    - [ ] `Vipps-System-Version`
    - [ ] `Vipps-System-Plugin-Name`
    - [ ] `Vipps-System-Plugin-Version`
 - [ ] Make sure to log and handle all errors.
       All integrations should to display errors in a way that the user can see and understand them.
 - [ ] Avoid Integration pitfalls
    - [ ] The Vipps branding must be according to the
          [Vipps design guidelines](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-design-guidelines).
    - [ ] Make sure your customer service, etc has all the tools and information they need
          available in _your_ system, through the APIs listed in the first item in this checklist,
          and that they do not need to visit
          [portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no)
          for normal work.

## Flow to go live for direct integrations

1. The merchant orders
   [Vipps p√• Nett](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/).
1. Vipps completes customer control (KYC, PEP, AML, etc).
1. The merchant receives an email from Vipps saying that they can log in with
   BankID on
   [portal.vipps.no][portal-url]
   and retrieve API keys.
1. The merchant completes all checklist items above.
   Please double-check to avoid mistakes.
1. The Merchant verifies the integration in the production environment (similar to step 5):
    - We recommend checking this using both the API itself and the API Dashboard available under _Utvikler_ on
      [portal.vipps.no][portal-url].
    - **Please note:** Vipps does not do any kind of activation or make any changes based on this checklist.
      The API keys for the production environment are made available on
      [portal.vipps.no][portal-url]
      as soon as the customer control (see step 2) is completed, independently of this checklist.
1. The Merchant goes live üéâ
